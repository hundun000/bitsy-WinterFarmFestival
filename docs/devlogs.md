### project idea

I like the game series *harvest moon(牧場物語)*. I have played the GB and GBA harvest moon games and other farming games such as *stardew valley*. I am impressed by the pixel worlds and enjoying the farming time. 

When I first met the bitsy engine, I wrote the [harvest-mushroom](https://hundun.itch.io/harvest-mushroom), a simple game only has few mechanisms about farming. 

In the Low Code Game Jam, I plan make a farming game with some new features(purchasement, more interaction to fields, more area...). This project will focus on the features of what player can do in winter. As a longer-term plan(not during this jam), the completed farming game will has a season changing system. Some parts of this project is inherit from the harvest-mushroom project, or they may be replaced later.

### about low-code

On the bitsy built-in language scripts side. Some scripts' text are generated by my java program which can uniform the variables names through different sections, repeatly generate some similar sections from one template... These scripts can be written in bity editer actually, so I consider that the java generator program's coding is not a part of the game project.(a joke is that programmers always want to automate jobs but spend more time on the automation coding. Here is I coding java for generating low-code-engine's scripts.)

On the bitsy hacks scripts side. I use some published and custom hacks to implement something like iterate-loop-block, array-variable and keyboard-input, which are not supported in the original bitsy but commonly uesed in programing. These hacks and calling are codes but I think they are necessary.

### 数值设计

每天可无条件采集n个（随机期望）作物；
购买斧头（nx元）后，每天可额外采集n个作物；
购买锄头（2nx元）后，每天可额外采集n个作物；
每个作物售价x元。游戏目标是5天结束时，至少拥有knx元。

1~2天，买第一个工具
3天，买第2个工具
4~5天，游戏胜利

令 n = 4, k = 5, x = 5

需要注意采集作重复劳动的枯燥感：
- 斧头解锁新区域，锄头挖地交互不同，用新鲜感缓解一下
- 最后两天挖3n个作物已经有点重复劳动了，不能更多天了
